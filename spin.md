## Quantum Computing - Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

### Postulates of Quantum Mechanics

##### 1. Measurements are represented by linear operators.
This ensures that states that are normalised stay normalised.

##### 2. The possible states and results corresponding to an a particular measurement are given by the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the measurement operator.

##### 3. The inner product of distinct states is 0.

##### 4. The probability of measuring blah blah

### Example - Spin

Spin can be roughly conceptualised as the intrinsic angular momentum of a particle. An electron has two distinct values of spin, up and down.


The Pauli matrices are as follows:

$$
\sigma_{z} = \quad
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end
{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\sigma_{x} = \quad
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\sigma_{y} = \quad
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

We also have that

$$ \langle \sigma_{x} \rangle^{2} + \langle \sigma_{y} \rangle^{2} + \langle \sigma_{z} \rangle^{2} = 1 $$
