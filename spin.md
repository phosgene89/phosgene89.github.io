## Quantum Computing - Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

### Postulates of Quantum Mechanics

1. Measurements are represented by linear operators.

2. The possible states and results corresponding to an a particular measurement are given by the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the measurement operator.

3. The inner product of distinct states is 0.

4. The probability of measuring blah blah

### Example - Spin

Spin can be roughly conceptualised as the intrinsic angular momentum of a particle. An electron has two distinct values of spin, up and down.


The Pauli matrices are as follows:

$$ \sigma_{z} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & -1
\end
\quad{bmatrix}

\sigma_{x} = \quad
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}

\sigma_{y} = \quad
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}$$
