## Quantum Computing - Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

### Postulates of Quantum Mechanics

1. Measurements are represented by linear operators.

2. The possible states and results corresponding to an a particular measurement are given by the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the measurement operator.

3. The inner product of distinct states is 0.

4. The probability of measuring blah blah

### Example - Spin

Spin can be roughly conceptualised as the intrinsic angular momentum of a particle. An electron has two distinct values of spin, up and down.


The Pauli matrices are as follows:

$ _sigma_{z} = \quad
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}$
