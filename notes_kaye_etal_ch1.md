## Overview
My notes from *Notes on An Introduction to Quantum Computing* by Phillip Kaye, Raymond Laflamme and Michele Mosca. Available <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Quantum-Computing-Phillip-Kaye/dp/019857049X">here</a>.

These notes are intended to be as concise as possible to enable *me* to recall and reconstruct concepts. As such, they will focus more on certain things and less on others.

## Chapter 1: Introduction and Background

## Chapter 2: Linear Algebra and the Dirac Notation
