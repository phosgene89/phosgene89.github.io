## Overview


## Bayesian Inference Overview
Bayesian inference is based on predicting probability distributions for model parameters using Bayes' theorem

$$P(\beta|X,y) = \frac{P(y|\beta, X) P(\beta|X)}{P(y|X)} $$

Where $\beta$ is a model parameter, $X$ is an array of input data and $y$ contains the target values.

### Why do Bayesian inference?

### Procedure

#### 1. Choose model paramaterisation.


#### 2. Choose priors.


#### 3. Gather data and use Bayes' theorem to calculate posterior probabilities.


#### 4. Repeat 3 as needed.
