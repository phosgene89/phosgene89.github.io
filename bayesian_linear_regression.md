## Overview


## Bayesian Inference
Bayesian inference is based on predicting probability distributions for model parameters using Bayes' theorem

$$P(\beta|X,y) = \frac{P(y|\beta, X) P(\beta|X)}{P(y|X)} $$

Where $\beta$ is a model parameter, $X$ is an array of input data and $y$ contains the target values.
